# C-41 development process, according to the C41 Digibase instructions
# It’s faster than the normal C-41 process (Fuji instructions), but works just
# fine with the Digibase chemicals I use.
#
# 3 m 15 sec of developer time (longer time should be used as chemicals are worn out)
#
# Doesn’t force wash procedure, simply calls for one rinsing - the user is trusted to do
# it correctly!
